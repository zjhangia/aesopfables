        <p>A Wolf had been hurt in a fight with a Bear. He was unable to move and could not satisfy his hunger and thirst. A Sheep passed by near his hiding place, and the Wolf called to him.</p>
        <p>"Please fetch me a drink of water," he begged, "that might give me strength enough so I can get me some solid food."</p>
        <p>"Solid food!" said the Sheep. "That means me, I suppose. If I should bring you a drink, it would only serve to wash me down your throat. Don't talk to me about a drink!"</p>

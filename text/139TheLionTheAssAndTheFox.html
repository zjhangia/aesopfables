        <h1>139. The Lion The Ass And The Fox</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>A Lion, an Ass, and a Fox were hunting in company, and caught a large quantity of game. The Ass was asked to divide the spoil. This he did very fairly, giving each an equal share.</p>
        <p>The Fox was well satisfied, but the Lion flew into a great rage over it, and with one stroke of his huge paw, he added the Ass to the pile of slain.</p>
        <p>Then he turned to the Fox.</p>
        <p>"You divide it," he roared angrily.</p>
        <p>The Fox wasted no time in talking. He quickly piled all the game into one great heap. From this he took a very small portion for himself, such undesirable bits as the horns and hoofs of a mountain goat, and the end of an ox tail.</p>
        <p>The Lion now recovered his good humor entirely.</p>
        <p>"Who taught you to divide so fairly?" he asked pleasantly.</p>
        <p>"I learned a lesson from the Ass," replied the Fox, carefully edging away.</p>

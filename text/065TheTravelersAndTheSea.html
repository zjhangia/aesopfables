        <p>Two Travelers were walking along the seashore. Far out they saw something riding on the waves.</p>
        <p>"Look," said one, "a great ship rides in from distant lands, bearing rich treasures!"</p>
        <p>The object they saw came ever nearer the shore.</p>
        <p>"No," said the other, "that is not a treasure ship. That is some fisherman's skiff, with the day's catch of savoury fish."</p>
        <p>Still nearer came the object. The waves washed it up on shore.</p>
        <p>"It is a chest of gold lost from some wreck," they cried. Both Travelers rushed to the beach, but there they found nothing but a water-soaked log.</p>

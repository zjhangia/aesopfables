        <h1>136. The Wolf The Kid And The Goat</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Mother Goat was going to market one morning to get provisions for her household, which consisted of but one little Kid and herself.</p>
        <p>"Take good care of the house, my son," she said to the Kid, as she carefully latched the door. "Do not let anyone in, unless he gives you this password: 'Down with the Wolf and all his race!'"</p>
        <p>Strangely enough, a Wolf was lurking near and heard what the Goat had said. So, as soon as Mother Goat was out of sight, up he trotted to the door and knocked.</p>
        <p>"Down with the Wolf and all his race," said the Wolf softly.</p>
        <p>It was the right password, but when the Kid peeped through a crack in the door and saw the shadowy figure outside, he did not feel at all easy.</p>
        <p>"Show me a white paw," he said, "or I won't let you in."</p>
        <p>A white paw, of course, is a feature few Wolves can show, and so Master Wolf had to go away as hungry as he had come.</p>
        <p>"You can never be too sure," said the Kid, when he saw the Wolf making off to the woods.</p>

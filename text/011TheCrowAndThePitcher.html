        <h1>011. The Crow And The Pitcher</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>In a spell of dry weather, when the Birds could find very little to drink, a thirsty Crow found a pitcher with a little water in it. But the pitcher was high and had a narrow neck, and no matter how he tried, the Crow could not reach the water.
            The poor thing felt as if he must die of thirst.</p>
        <p>Then an idea came to him. Picking up some small pebbles, he dropped them into the pitcher one by one. With each pebble the water rose a little higher until at last it was near enough so he could drink.</p>

        <h1>059. The Ass The Fox And The Lion</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>An Ass and a Fox had become close comrades, and were constantly in each other's company. While the Ass cropped a fresh bit of greens, the Fox would devour a chicken from the neighboring farmyard or a bit of cheese filched from the dairy. One day
            the pair unexpectedly met a Lion. The Ass was very much frightened, but the Fox calmed his fears.</p>
        <p>"I will talk to him," he said.</p>
        <p>So the Fox walked boldly up to the Lion.</p>
        <p>"Your highness," he said in an undertone, so the Ass could not hear him, "I've got a fine scheme in my head. If you promise not to hurt me, I will lead that foolish creature yonder into a pit where he can't get out, and you can feast at your pleasure."</p>
        <p>The Lion agreed and the Fox returned to the Ass.</p>
        <p>"I made him promise not to hurt us," said the Fox. "But come, I know a good place to hide till he is gone."</p>
        <p>So the Fox led the Ass into a deep pit. But when the Lion saw that the Ass was his for the taking, he first of all struck down the traitor Fox.</p>

        <h1>128. The Stag The Sheep And The Wolf</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>One day a Stag came to a Sheep and asked her to lend him a measure of wheat. The Sheep knew him for a very swift runner, who could easily take himself out of reach, were he so inclined. So she asked him if he knew someone who would answer for
            him.
        </p>
        <p>"Yes, yes," answered the Stag confidently, "the Wolf has promised to be my surety."</p>
        <p>"The Wolf!" exclaimed the Sheep indignantly. "Do you think I would trust you on such security? I know the Wolf! He takes what he wants and runs off with it without paying. As for you, you can use your legs so well that I should have little chance
            of collecting the debt if I had to catch you for it!"</p>

        <h1>043. The Farmer And The Stork</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>A Stork of a very simple and trusting nature had been asked by a gay party of Cranes to visit a field that had been newly planted. But the party ended dismally with all the birds entangled in the meshes of the Farmer's net.</p>
        <p>The Stork begged the Farmer to spare him.</p>
        <p>"Please let me go," he pleaded. "I belong to the Stork family who you know are honest and birds of good character. Besides, I did not know the Cranes were going to steal."</p>
        <p>"You may be a very good bird," answered the Farmer, "but I caught you with the thieving Cranes and you will have to share the same punishment with them."</p>

        <h1>045. The Traverlers And The Purse</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Two men were traveling in company along the road when one of them picked up a well-filled purse.</p>
        <p>"How lucky I am!" he said. "I have found a purse. Judging by its weight it must be full of gold."</p>
        <p>"Do not say 'I have found a purse,'" said his companion. "Say rather 'we have found a purse' and 'how lucky we are.' Travelers ought to share alike the fortunes or misfortunes of the road."</p>
        <p>"No, no," replied the other angrily. "I found it and I am going to keep it."</p>
        <p>Just then they heard a shout of "Stop, thief!" and looking around, saw a mob of people armed with clubs coming down the road.</p>
        <p>The man who had found the purse fell into a panic.</p>
        <p>"We are lost if they find the purse on us," he cried.</p>
        <p>"No, no," replied the other, "You would not say 'we' before, so now stick to your 'I'. Say 'I am lost.'"</p>

        <h3>We cannot expect any one to share our misfortunes unless we are willing to share our good fortune also.</h3>

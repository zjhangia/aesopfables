        <p>A Gnat flew over the meadow with much buzzing for so small a creature and settled on the tip of one of the horns of a Bull. After he had rested a short time, he made ready to fly away. But before he left he begged the Bull's pardon for having
            used his horn for a resting place.</p>
        <p>"You must be very glad to have me go now," he said.</p>
        <p>"It's all the same to me," replied the Bull. "I did not even know you were there."</p>

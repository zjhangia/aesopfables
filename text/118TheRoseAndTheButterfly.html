        <h1>118. The Rose And The Butterfly</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>A Butterfly once fell in love with a beautiful Rose. The Rose was not indifferent, for the Butterfly's wings were powdered in a charming pattern of gold and silver. And so, when he fluttered near and told how he loved her, she blushed rosily and
            said yes. After much pretty love-making and many whispered vows of constancy, the Butterfly took a tender leave of his sweetheart.</p>
        <p>But alas! It was a long time before he came back to her.</p>
        <p>"Is this your constancy?" she exclaimed tearfully. "It is ages since you went away, and all the time, you have been carrying on with all sorts of flowers. I saw you kiss Miss Geranium, and you fluttered around Miss Mignonette until Honey Bee chased
            you away. I wish he had stung you!"</p>
        <p>"Constancy!" laughed the Butterfly. "I had no sooner left you than I saw Zephyr kissing you. You carried on scandalously with Mr. Bumble Bee and you made eyes at every single Bug you could see. You can't expect any constancy from me!"</p>

    </div>
    <div class="moral">
        <h3>Do not expect constancy in others if you have none yourself.</h3>

        <h1>130. The Shepherd And The Lion</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>A Shepherd, counting his Sheep one day, discovered that a number of them were missing.</p>
        <p>Much irritated, he very loudly and boastfully declared that he would catch the thief and punish him as he deserved. The Shepherd suspected a Wolf of the deed and so set out toward a rocky region among the hills, where there were caves infested
            by Wolves. But before starting out he made a vow to Jupiter that if he would help him find the thief he would offer a fat Calf as a sacrifice.</p>
        <p>The Shepherd searched a long time without finding any Wolves, but just as he was passing near a large cave on the mountain side, a huge Lion stalked out, carrying a Sheep. In great terror the Shepherd fell on his knees.</p>
        <p>"Alas, O Jupiter, man does not know what he asks! To find the thief I offered to sacrifice a fat Calf. Now I promise you a full-grown Bull, if you but make the thief go away!"</p>

        <div class="moral">
            <h3>We are often not so eager for what we seek, after we have found it.</h3>
            <h3>Do not foolishly ask for things that would bring ruin if they were granted.</h3>

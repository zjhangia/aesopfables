        <h1>121. The Old Lion</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>A Lion had grown very old. His teeth were worn away. His limbs could no longer bear him, and the King of Beasts was very pitiful indeed as he lay gasping on the ground, about to die.</p>
        <p>Where now his strength and his former graceful beauty?</p>
        <p>Now a Boar spied him, and rushing at him, gored him with his yellow tusk. A Bull trampled him with his heavy hoofs. Even a contemptible Ass let fly his heels and brayed his insults in the face of the Lion.</p>

        <h3>It is cowardly to attack the defenseless, though he be an enemy.</h3>

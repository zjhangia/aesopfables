        <h1>098. The Dog And The Oyster</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>There was once a Dog who was very fond of eggs. He visited the hen house very often and at last got so greedy that he would swallow the eggs whole.</p>
        <p>One day the Dog wandered down to the seashore. There he spied an Oyster. In a twinkling the Oyster was resting in the Dog's stomach, shell and all.</p>
        <p>It pained the Dog a good deal, as you can guess.</p>
        <p>"I've learned that all round things are not eggs," he said groaning.</p>

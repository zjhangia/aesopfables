    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>A Fox, swimming across a river, was barely able to reach the bank, where he lay bruised and exhausted from his struggle with the swift current. Soon a swarm of blood-sucking flies settled on him; but he lay quietly, still too weak to run away
            from them.</p>
        <p>A Hedgehog happened by. "Let me drive the flies away," he said kindly.</p>
        <p>"No, no!" exclaimed the Fox, "do not disturb them! They have taken all they can hold. If you drive them away, another greedy swarm will come and take the little blood I have left."</p>

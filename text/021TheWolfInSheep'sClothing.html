        <h1>021. The Wolf In Sheep's Clothing</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>A certain Wolf could not get enough to eat because of the watchfulness of the Shepherds. But one night he found a sheep skin that had been cast aside and forgotten. The next day, dressed in the skin, the Wolf strolled into the pasture with the
            Sheep. Soon a little Lamb was following him about and was quickly led away to slaughter.</p>
        <p>That evening the Wolf entered the fold with the flock. But it happened that the Shepherd took a fancy for mutton broth that very evening, and, picking up a knife, went to the fold. There the first he laid hands on and killed was the Wolf.</p>

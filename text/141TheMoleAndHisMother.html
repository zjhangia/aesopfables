        <p>A little Mole once said to his Mother:</p>
        <p>"Why, Mother, you said I was blind! But I am sure I can see!"</p>
        <p>Mother Mole saw she would have to get such conceit out of his head. So she put a bit of frankincense before him and asked him to tell what it was.</p>
        <p>The little Mole peered at it.</p>
        <p>"Why, that's a pebble!"</p>
        <p>"Well, my son, that proves you've lost your sense of smell as well as being blind."</p>

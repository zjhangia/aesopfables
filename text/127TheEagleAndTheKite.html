        <h1>127. The Eagle And The Kite</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>An Eagle sat high in the branches of a great Oak. She seemed very sad and drooping for an Eagle. A Kite saw her.</p>
        <p>"Why do you look so woebegone?" asked the Kite.</p>
        <p>"I want to get married," replied the Eagle, "and I can't find a mate who can provide for me as I should like."</p>
        <p>"Take me," said the Kite; "I am very strong, stronger even than you!"</p>
        <p>"Do you really think you can provide for me?" asked the Eagle eagerly.</p>
        <p>"Why, of course," replied the Kite. "That would be a very simple matter. I am so strong I can carry away an Ostrich in my talons as if it were a feather!"</p>
        <p>The Eagle accepted the Kite immediately. But after the wedding, when the Kite flew away to find something to eat for his bride, all he had when he returned, was a tiny Mouse.</p>
        <p>"Is that the Ostrich you talked about?" said the Eagle in disgust.</p>
        <p>"To win you I would have said and promised anything," replied the Kite.</p>

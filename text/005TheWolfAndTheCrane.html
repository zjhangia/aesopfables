        <h1>005. The Wolf And The Crane</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>A Wolf had been feasting too greedily, and a bone had stuck crosswise in his throat. He could get it neither up nor down, and of course he could not eat a thing. Naturally that was an awful state of affairs for a greedy Wolf.</p>
        <p>So away he hurried to the Crane. He was sure that she, with her long neck and bill, would easily be able to reach the bone and pull it out.</p>
        <p>"I will reward you very handsomely," said the Wolf, "if you pull that bone out for me."</p>
        <p>The Crane, as you can imagine, was very uneasy about putting her head in a Wolf's throat. But she was grasping in nature, so she did what the Wolf asked her to do.</p>
        <p>When the Wolf felt that the bone was gone, he started to walk away.</p>
        <p>"But what about my reward!" called the Crane anxiously.</p>
        <p>"What!" snarled the Wolf, whirling around. "Haven't you got it? Isn't it enough that I let you take your head out of my mouth without snapping it off?"</p>

        <p>A Mule had had a long rest and much good feeding. He was feeling very vigorous indeed, and pranced around loftily, holding his head high.</p>
        <p>"My father certainly was a full-blooded racer," he said. "I can feel that distinctly."</p>
        <p>Next day he was put into harness again and that evening he was very downhearted indeed.</p>
        <p>"I was mistaken," he said. "My father was an Ass after all."</p>

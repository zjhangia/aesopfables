        <h1>114. The Bat And The Weasels</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>A Bat blundered into the nest of a Weasel, who ran up to catch and eat him. The Bat begged for his life, but the Weasel would not listen.</p>
        <p>"You are a Mouse," he said, "and I am a sworn enemy of Mice. Every Mouse I catch, I am going to eat!"</p>
        <p>"But I am not a Mouse!" cried the Bat. "Look at my wings. Can Mice fly? Why, I am only a Bird! Please let me go!"</p>
        <p>The Weasel had to admit that the Bat was not a Mouse, so he let him go. But a few days later, the foolish Bat went blindly into the nest of another Weasel. This Weasel happened to be a bitter enemy of Birds, and he soon had the Bat under his claws,
            ready to eat him.</p>
        <p>"You are a Bird," he said, "and I am going to eat you!"</p>
        <p>"What," cried the Bat, "I, a Bird! Why, all Birds have feathers! I am nothing but a Mouse. 'Down with all Cats,' is my motto!"</p>
        <p>And so the Bat escaped with his life a second time.</p>

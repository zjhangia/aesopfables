    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>A poor Fisherman, who lived on the fish he caught, had bad luck one day and caught nothing but a very small fry. The Fisherman was about to put it in his basket when the little Fish said:</p>
        <p>"Please spare me, Mr. Fisherman! I am so small it is not worth while to carry me home. When I am bigger, I shall make you a much better meal."</p>
        <p>But the Fisherman quickly put the fish into his basket.</p>
        <p>"How foolish I should be," he said, "to throw you back. However small you may be, you are better than nothing at all."</p>
